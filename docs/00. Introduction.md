# Main ./src/components
Project is separated by blocks and components, with SASS preprocessor for css. <br>
For best programming experience we used jQuery + some custom js libs. <br>
Bootstrap not used because there was no need. We use max-width + max-height responsive. <br>
### Blocks
Here we store simple html blocks with their css.
### Search
The search component sends a request to the server at n-second intervals <br>
(written in the .env of the project) after the user has finished typing, <br>
and shows the search results in the form of a drop-down list with price tags, discounts, and previews.
### Cart
The component deals with adding items to the cart. <br>
The logic is divided into two parts - for authorized users we get their cart from the server, <br>
for guests we get their cart from the session, or write to the session if it is empty. <br>
When the number of items in the cart is changed or deleted, a request is made to the server <br>
to update the data in real time. 

# Codestyle
Please, use $varName if it jQuery instance, or use varName if not. <br>
Also, use .env file and env.VAR_NAME helper if you need store some dynamic component data. <br>
